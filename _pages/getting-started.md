This page is about getting started running the agent.  Please navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/aidanbean/ECS170-AI" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository and follow these steps.

## Folder Description:

`agents`: contain runnable sc2 agents

`dqn`: DQN practice under OPENAI

`explore`: exploration files on `pysc2` package

`images`: network structure graph and gameplay screenshots

`others`: utilies

`q-learning`: q learning relative exploration files

`replay`: replay in bin format

`resources`: some researches and ideas

`save_model`: tensorflow event files

`tensorflow practice`: practice files on tensorflow, dqn and dueling dqn

## Running the agent
Under folder `agents/`

Dueling DQN agent:
```shell
python -m main --agent=dueling_agent.dueling_agent.DuelingAgent
```

DQN agent:
```shell
ï»¿python -m main --agent=dqn_agent.dqn_agent.DQNAgent
```

## Setting game configuration
Under file `agents/main.py`

## Setting agent configuration
Under file `agents/run_loop.py`

## Setting game configuration:
Under file `agents/main.py`

## Setting agent configuration:
Under file `agents/run_loop.py`

## Description:

Both DQN agents are capable of running the full game as they are extended (with different degree of changes) with network structure from DeepMind's paper. Yet, the current reward function defined in `agents/*_agent/utils.py` is only for minigame `BuildMarines`. If you want the agent to perform better in the full game or other mini-games, please feel free to define new reward functions respectively.


## Version:
The agents are runnable under following environment configuration.

`python`: 2.7 or 3.*

`pysc2`: after 5/31/2018

`tensorflow`: latest version on gpu or cpu

`StarCraft II`: 4.1.2 Linux version
